# Scratch-off Media (Images & Videos)

Add your images or videos here with the naming convention: `day-1.mp4`, `day-2.jpg`, etc.

The advent calendar will display these behind a scratch-off overlay when each door is opened.

## Supported Formats:
- **Videos**: MP4 (e.g., `day-1.mp4`, `day-2.mp4`)
- **Images**: JPG or PNG (e.g., `day-3.jpg`, `day-4.png`)

## How it works:
1. The system first looks for a video file (`day-X.mp4`)
2. If video doesn't exist, it falls back to image (`day-X.jpg`)
3. If neither exists, a festive emoji placeholder is shown

## Recommended:
- **Videos**: MP4 format, autoplay and loop enabled, muted
- **Images**: JPG or PNG format
- **Naming**: `day-1` through `day-24` (with appropriate extension)
- **Size**: Any size (automatically scaled to fit)

Videos will automatically play when revealed through scratching!
